			<p>I am someone with a very diverse background.  I started out as a profesional musician (I still consider myself one!), a classical pianist to be precise, and around 5 years ago I decided to transition into a field that could provide a bit more stability.  That's how I ended up in the International Development sector.  Now I am looking into implementing a few ideas that will hopefully have a bit of a positive impact around the world.</p>
